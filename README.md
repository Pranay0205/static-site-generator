# Static Site Generator

A Python-based static site generator that transforms Markdown files into a complete static website. Users write content in Markdown format, and the generator handles the conversion to HTML and the structuring of the final website.

Key functionality:

- Reads Markdown files from a content directory
- Converts Markdown files to HTML
- Applies basic HTML templates for consistent page layouts
- Outputs a complete static website

The focus is on simplicity - making it easy to create and maintain a basic website without databases or complex server-side operations.
